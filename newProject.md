# Lambda Calculus Visual Calculator

## Project Overview

The Lambda Calculus Visual Calculator is an interactive educational tool that visualizes mathematical computation through the lens of lambda calculus. Users enter familiar mathematical expressions (like `3+4` or `2*(5-1)`), and the application demonstrates how these calculations are processed using animated Tromp diagrams, revealing the underlying computational model before presenting the final result.

## Core Concept

The application bridges the gap between everyday arithmetic and theoretical computer science by:

1. Accepting standard mathematical notation as input
2. Converting expressions to lambda calculus under the hood
3. Visualizing the step-by-step evaluation using Tromp diagrams
4. Translating the result back to conventional notation

## User Experience

### Workflow

1. **Input**: User enters a mathematical expression using a familiar calculator interface
2. **Conversion**: Expression is silently converted to lambda calculus representation
3. **Visualization**: Animated Tromp diagram shows the computation process
4. **Result**: Final answer is displayed in standard mathematical notation

### Example User Flow

1. User types `4+1` in the calculator input
2. The application converts this to its lambda calculus form using Church encodings
3. A Tromp diagram appears showing the initial structure of the expression
4. The diagram animates through beta reductions, showing how the computation proceeds
5. When the evaluation completes, `5` appears as the result in the calculator display

## Interface Components

### Calculator Input

- Clean, minimal calculator interface with number pad and operators
- Support for basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)
- Parentheses for expression grouping
- History of previous calculations

### Visualization Panel

- Interactive Tromp diagram display
- Animation controls (play, pause, step forward/backward, speed control)
- Visual distinction between different node types (variables, abstractions, applications)
- Highlighting to show active reduction steps

### Educational Panel

- Optional explanation of each reduction step
- Toggle to show lambda calculus notation alongside the diagram
- Information tooltips for concepts like Church numerals and beta reduction

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

1. **Math Parser**: Converts standard math notation to abstract syntax trees
2. **Lambda Calculus Engine**: Transforms math AST to lambda calculus using Church encodings
3. **Evaluator**: Performs beta reductions on lambda expressions
4. **Diagram Generator**: Creates and updates Tromp diagrams based on lambda expressions
5. **Animation Controller**: Manages the visualization of reduction steps

### Visualization Approach

The Tromp diagram visualization will:
- Represent abstraction nodes (λ) as diamonds
- Represent application nodes (@) as rectangles
- Represent variables as circles
- Show connections between nodes as directional edges
- Use color and animation to highlight active reduction sites
- Smoothly transition between reduction steps
