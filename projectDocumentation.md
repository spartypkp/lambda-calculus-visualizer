# Lambda Calculus Visualizer Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to create an interactive web application for visualizing lambda calculus operations using Tromp diagrams. The application will serve as both an educational tool and a practical calculator for those working with lambda calculus, providing intuitive visual representations of abstract lambda expressions and their reductions.

The core functionality includes:
- Parsing and validating lambda calculus expressions
- Generating visual Tromp diagrams from these expressions
- Animating beta reductions and other lambda calculus operations
- Providing an intuitive user interface for interaction with the visualizations

## User Experience (UX) Design

### Main Interface Components

1. **Expression Input Panel**
   - Text input field with syntax highlighting for lambda expressions
   - Standard notation support (e.g., `λx.λy.x y` or `\x.\y.x y`)
   - Error highlighting for invalid expressions
   - History of recent expressions
   - Library of example expressions (Church numerals, combinators, etc.)

2. **Visualization Canvas**
   - Primary display area for the Tromp diagram
   - Interactive navigation:
     - Zoom in/out
     - Pan across the diagram
     - Select and highlight specific nodes
   - Responsive sizing based on complexity of the expression

3. **Operation Controls**
   - Step-by-step reduction controls
   - Play/pause/reset animation buttons
   - Speed control for animations
   - Option to show intermediate steps

4. **Information Panel**
   - Display of the current expression in text form
   - Explanation of the current step in a reduction sequence
   - Variable binding information
   - Performance metrics (steps to normal form, etc.)

### User Interactions

1. **Expression Entry and Editing**
   - Direct typing with auto-completion
   - Syntax validation in real-time
   - Quick selection from common expressions
   - Copy/paste support

2. **Diagram Interaction**
   - Hovering over a node highlights all related bindings
   - Clicking on a subexpression selects it for focused view
   - Dragging nodes to rearrange the layout (optional)
   - Right-click context menu for operations on subexpressions

3. **Reduction Workflow**
   - Select a redex (reducible expression)
   - View the step-by-step beta reduction
   - Compare before/after states
   - Automatically reduce to normal form (if it exists)

4. **Educational Features**
   - Toggle explanations for each step
   - Switch between different visualization styles
   - Save/export diagrams as SVG or PNG

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Architecture

1. **Component Structure**
   - Layout components (Header, Sidebar, Canvas, Controls)
   - Functional components for specific UI elements
   - Specialized visualization components

2. **State Management**
   - Store the current lambda expression and its parsed representation
   - Track reduction history and current reduction step
   - Manage UI state (selected nodes, zoom level, etc.)
   - Handle user preferences and settings

3. **Interaction Handlers**
   - Input validation and processing
   - Diagram interaction (zoom, pan, select)
   - Animation control
   - Export functionality

### Backend Requirements

The application can be primarily client-side, but may benefit from some backend services:

1. **Optional Server Components**
   - Expression storage and sharing
   - User accounts for saving expressions
   - Computing complex reductions for large expressions

2. **API Endpoints (if needed)**
   - `/api/parse` - Parse and validate lambda expressions
   - `/api/reduce` - Perform reduction steps
   - `/api/save` - Save expressions to database
   - `/api/examples` - Retrieve predefined examples

### Lambda Calculus Engine

1. **Parser**
   - Tokenize input strings
   - Build abstract syntax tree (AST)
   - Validate well-formedness
   - Handle different syntactic variations

2. **Evaluator**
   - Identify redexes
   - Perform substitutions correctly (avoiding variable capture)
   - Execute different reduction strategies (normal order, applicative order)
   - Detect non-terminating reductions

3. **Diagram Generator**
   - Transform AST into Tromp diagram structure
   - Handle variable binding visualization
   - Optimize layout for readability
   - Support different diagram styles
